# Executing BERT model as TVM object

The purpose of this project is to explore how one can convert a single-layered BERT model into Apache TVMâ€™s intermediate representation (IR) and subsequently transform this IR into an executable. Below are instructions on how to use the above two source files to accomplish this task.


## Installing a Python package manager

Use a package manager, such as pip or conda, to install the necessary dependencies in a virtual environment. I recommend using conda: https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html.

## Installing TVM

Install the latest version of TVM: https://tvm.apache.org/docs/install/from_source.html

## Create virtual environment with python 3.8

Create a virtual environment using the package manager chosen in step 1. For example, if you are using conda as your package manager, enter the command 
```bash
conda create -n myenv python=3.8
```
in your terminal. 

Activate the environment with the command

```bash
conda activate myenv
```
## Install the necessary dependencies 
In the virtual environment, install the necessary dependencies. If you are using conda, run each of the following in your terminal:
```bash
conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio cudatoolkit=10.2 -c pytorch
```
```bash
conda install -c huggingface transformers
```
```bash
conda install -c conda-forge onnx
```
```bash
conda install numpy
```
If you are using a different package manager, install the dependencies using that package manager.
Also make sure to install the dependencies mentioned at the bottom of the TVM installation instructions: https://tvm.apache.org/docs/install/from_source.html
These dependencies include typing-extensions, psutil, and scipy.

## Configure and export a single-layered BERT model to ONNX

Navigate to the directory in which TVM is installed. Then, navigate to the python subdirectory:
```bash
cd python
```
In this directory, create a new ```.py``` file. In this new file, copy and paste the contents of ```export-bert```. Run this file on the command line:
```python <filename1>.py```

Now, in your current directory, you should see a file named ```single-layer.onnx```. 

## Load the single-layered BERT model and run the graph
In the current directory  create a new ```.py``` file. In this new file, copy and paste the contents of ```load-onnx```. Run this file on the command line:
```python <filename2>.py```

After running this command, you have successfully converted a single-layered BERT model to TVM format and ran an executable version of the model.
